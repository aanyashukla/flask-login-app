**Flask Login App**

I'm currently familiarizing myself with the basics of Flask and exploring how to build web applications using Python. 
This project is a simple login page that demonstrates core Flask concepts such as routing, handling form submissions and
rendering templates.


* 🔁 **Redirect to Login:** Visiting the root URL (`/`) redirects users to the login page.
* 🔐 **User Login Functionality:** Authenticates users using their email and password with a POST form.
* 📬 **Signup Feature:** Allows new users to register by providing name, email, and password.
* 🧠 **Custom User Check Logic:** Uses helper functions (`find_user`, `add_user`) to interact with a backend database.
* 💬 **Dynamic Feedback:** Renders a common `response.html` template for showing success or failure messages.
* 🌐 **Runs on 0.0.0.0:** App is accessible on all interfaces at port 5000 when run locally.
